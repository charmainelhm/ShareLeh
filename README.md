# ShareLeh

This is an android application created for a school project in Singapore University of Social Sciences.

ShareLeh is a food sharing application where users can share food which they may have too much of with other users who may need them, and thereby creating a new outlet for Singaporeans to obtain food items for their daily consumption.

Two main functions of the application:
- Users can browse through the listings to look for food items that they need, and reserve those items

Product features:
